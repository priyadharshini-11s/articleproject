                A news article is the finished product or piece of writing that results from newswriting. Unlike other types of writing, such as technical or creative writing, which focus on detailed explanations or artistic expression, news articles prioritize delivering verified facts in a succinct, structured format.
                This structure lays out information so that the most important details come first, making it easy for readers to get the main points even if they don’t read the entire article.

                Following the inverted pyramid, you start with the most important content—the “who, what, when, where, why, and how.” This is your lead, which we’ll explain in more detail below.
                
                Then, you add details, like quotes and more context.
                
                Finally, at the bottom, you include extra information that’s good for the reader to know but not essential.

                Journal articles are the mainstay of academic publishing. They are original, peer-reviewed research that appears in a scholarly journal. The idea behind peer review is that other experts in the field review your article before it is published and help ensure that it is scientifically sound.

These articles usually have a fancy name, called the title, and they’re usually written in sections, like an introduction, methods, results, and conclusion. The cool thing about them is that they use big words, but they also explain them, so you don’t feel lost. Oh, and they also have cool pictures and graphs to help you understand the information better.

Now, you might be wondering, “Why should I care about journal articles?” Well, my little friend, they are like a magic portal to new knowledge!

When you read them, you can learn about exciting discoveries, cool experiments, and amazing facts that you might not find anywhere else. Plus, they can help you when you’re doing research.
ournal articles are like hidden gems of knowledge, and In this blog, we’re going to talk about what journal articles are. We will also give you a few simple tips moving on in the article so that you better understand journal articles.

So now, whether you’re a student, a budding researcher e, or just a curious mind, this blog will be your guide.

                A research article is a written paper that illustrates an outcome of scientific research with supporting clinical data. This differs from other types of informative articles, such as magazine features or research papers, which typically address the topic in a general scope as a means of introduction. A research article, on the other hand, is written by and for researchers for the purpose of making specific findings known to the scientific community at large. In fact, rather than appearing in a consumer or industry publication, a research article is found exclusively in a peer-reviewed scientific or medical journal, such as The Journal of the American Medical Association, for example.

Another key difference between other papers and a research article is that the latter strictly presents facts, rather than serve as a letter of opinion or a summary of the existing scientific literature. However, most scientific journals simultaneously publish such letters, as well as reviews of the body of existing research methods and findings.

As with any type of targeted writing, there is a protocol to follow when writing a research article in terms of layout. The title, for example, should provide a summary statement that either describes the research or presents the main conclusion drawn from the work. This not only helps the article to be noticed in table of contents in the print version of the scientific journal, but also assists in indexing the article in electronic forms. For instance, PubMed Medline is an online database of published journal material provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. A lookup of a key word or phrase scans articles published in thousands of scientific journals, and returns search results according to their relevance in the title.

The author or authors of a research article are listed according to their degree of contribution to the work, easily permitting one to identify the lead researcher. The last name followed by first and middle initials format is typically used. When there are many authors presenting the article, only the first three names are usually required to include when referencing or citing the article in another paper. In addition, one author is usually selected to serve as a contact for further information or comment about the article, as well as the party responsible for future amendments or updates. If appropriate, the affiliated university or research facility follows the authors’ names.

While most other forms of articles contain a summary at its end, the process is reversed in a research article. In fact, the summary, known as the abstract, precedes the full content of the paper. There is also a specific formula for its construction. It contains one or two introductory sentences explaining the necessity of the research performed, followed by the methodology used, the results found, and how the researchers applied the results. Finally, the abstract contains a single sentence representing a statement of conclusion of the authors based on these findings.

                A travel article is a piece of writing that describes a place, event, or experience. Travel articles can be either first-hand accounts or opinions about a destination. They are often written by people who have visited the place or taken part in the event, but they can also be penned by armchair travelers who have read extensively about a particular destination.

Travel articles typically focus on describing the author’s impressions of a place, offering insights into its history, culture, and attractions. However, they can also provide practical information such as tips on how to get there, where to stay, and what to see. Whether they are offering information or inspiration, travel articles give readers a taste of what it is like to visit a particular destination.

                Do you know how to write a travel article? Well, whether you’re writing for a travel website, magazine, or newspaper, there are some basic steps you can follow to write a great travel article.

Research is crucial if you want your article to be accurate and informative. Depending on your topic, you might need to do on-the-ground research, interview experts, or simply read up on the subject. Make sure to allow enough time for research before your deadline.
Your opening paragraph should be catchy and intriguing, to make the reader want to keep reading. Don’t give too much away though – the rest of your article should contain the meat of your argument or story.
Organize your article clearly, with a strong introduction, main body, and conclusion.
The introduction should briefly outline what you’ll be talking about, while the main body expands on this with more detail.
The conclusion should sum up your argument or story and leave the reader with something to think about.
Use strong, active language and concrete images to bring your writing to life. Be creative – try to paint a picture in the reader’s mind of what you’re describing.
Proofread your article carefully before submitting it to make sure there are no typos or grammatical errors.
A good travel article educates the reader and helps them to plan their trip. It should be well-researched, informative and entertaining. To write a good travel article, you need to have a strong understanding of your destination, as well as a passion for writing. With these tips in mind, you’re well on your way to writing a great travel article!

                If your heart is really into it, you can customise your magazine's size to be anything you want, depending on the style of magazine you're creating (even if it's more challenging to produce). However, if you're wondering about regular sizes that define a magazine, there's:

                standard magazine dimensions (8.5 x 11 inches, or 21.59 x 27.94 cm): the most common magazine size, and the one you're probably most familiar with.
                compact magazine dimensions (5.5 x 8.5 inches, or 13.97 x 21.59 cm): also known as the "digest size", this one is smaller and often used in niche publications.

                Articles are mostly written content that fill up the pages of a magazine, meaning they're the meaty part.

Articles focus on one topic related to the style of magazine they're in (be it news, lifestyle, travel, etc.). They can be long or short, superficial or in-depth, image-heavy or wordy. Their structure is typically made up of a headline, byline, body, and visuals (like the pictures of a magazine, infographics, charts, and more).

                A personal essay is a short, non-fiction narrative essay that is entirely written from the writer’s point of view. That means it’s okay to use the “I” or first-person perspective. It is the one type of essay writing in which the author can simply use his own thoughts and experiences as reference point.

                Unlike academic or technical essays, personal essays are very flexible in terms of structure and tone. They may take a storytelling approach—or they may be even more creative by adopting a poetic tone and dreamlike structure. There is really no right or wrong way to do it. The defining characteristic of a personal essay is simply its intimate, conversational voice, which lets the reader glimpse into the writer’s mind and personal life. It is like a sit-down with the author.
